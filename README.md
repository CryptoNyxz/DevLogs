# DevLogs
Password-Protected Virtual Diary/Journal made with Kivy

DevLogs is a GUI application made using the Kivy Framework

Users can create accounts and store their juiciest secrets ever.
Or maybe they just want to type down their daily lives.

DevLogs can be your virtual diary, and what's more, it's **password-protected**
People who want to know your deepest darkest secrets can't do it without knowing your password.
Don't even think about checking the data files either, because they're **encrypted**.
And it'll take intruders a **long** time to break in.
